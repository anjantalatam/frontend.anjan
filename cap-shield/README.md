3. Open index.html or use live server extension from VS-Code

### Code Explained ðŸ‘‡

1. First, let's start with shield which has 5 main divs. ( red, white, red2, blue, star )

2. Code each div separately and try to center them with respect to parent div.

3. Set padding, margin of all elements to `0` in the beginning to avoid unintended spacing.

4. Five pointed star is a bit tricky in the entire code which you need to explore by changing some code inside `five-pointed-star`, `:before`, `:after `and understand how the code works.

5. Now to add some spice I have added the text at the top and captain's upper part sliding from top and lower part sliding from bottom.

6. This is done using animation which is not too complex. You can easily understand from the classes `.cap-upper` and `.cap-lower` in the code.
